            <h1>DONATION FOR HELPLESS</h1>
            <p>Happiness is found in helping others. Despite the self-help messages so prevalent today, life is not all
                about your happiness. For many people this is hard to hear. It’s not the uplifting message they’re
                looking
                for, but it is true nonetheless. Current culture makes it very easy to think that our own happiness is
                the
                main goal and the most important pursuit. However, to the contrary, life is about serving others and
                caring
                about the good of those around us. </p>

    <section class="aboutUsD">
        <div>
            <h1>About our Foundation</h1>
            <p>Our Foundation, an Bangladeshi social development organization, is directly benefitting over 15 lakh
                children and their families every year. We have more than 400 live welfare projects on education,
                healthcare, livelihood, and women’s empowerment in over 2,000 remote villages and urban slums across 25
                states of Bangladesh.

                The groundwork for a better life lies in education. It is the most powerful catalyst for social
                transformation. However, a child cannot be educated in isolation. Only an empowered family, especially
                the mother, would be willing to educate their child. Thus, rather than focusing on only one stage of a
                person's life, we believe in the lifecycle approach.

                Education empowers an individual to earn their livelihood and also increases one's awareness on a range
                of issues. From healthcare, to appropriate social behavior, to understanding one's rights – Smile
                Foundation seeks to educate, empower and cultivate better citizens.</p>
